### Fraud Detection

For years, fraud has been a major issue in sectors like banking, medical, insurance, and many others. Due to the increase in online transactions through different payment options, such as credit/debit cards, PhonePe, Gpay, Paytm, etc., fraudulent activities have also increased. Moreover, fraudsters or criminals have become very skilled in finding escapes so that they can loot more. Since no system is perfect and there is always a loophole them, it has become a challenging task to make a secure system for authentication and preventing customers from fraud. So, Fraud detection algorithms are very useful for preventing frauds.

Types of Internet Fraud:
•	Email Phishing
•	Payment Fraud
•	ID Document Forgery
•	Identity Theft 

Email Phishing: This is a fraud or cybercrime wherein attackers send fake sites and messages to users via email. These emails are seemingly legit and authentic that anyone can misjudge them and enter the vulnerable data that puts them at risk. The best way to prevent email phishing is to avoid entering vulnerable data in these emails until you verify their credentials. And the best way is to ignore these emails or messages that flash on your screen. Traditional methods for phishing involve the use of filters. These filters are primarily of two types, authentication protection, and network-level protection. Authentication protection is through email verification. Network-level protection is through three filters; whitelist, blacklist, and pattern matching. Now all these methods are automated through classical Machine Learning algorithms for classification and regression. 

Payment Fraud: These types of fraud are very common in today’s card systems for banking. Fraudsters can steal cards, make counterfeit cards, steal Card ID, etc. Once they steal the confidential data of a user, they can buy things, apply for a loan, and pretty much anything they imagine. 

ID Document Forgery: Nowadays these criminals and fraudsters can buy ID proof of a person and use that to enter a system, make use of it, and without any impact get out if it. This type of fraud can put many organizations at risk as these fraudsters can get access to their systems by faking an ID Document and cheating them. These fraudsters are skillful in creating more legit IDs. So old systems which are used to prevent Identity forging are no more capable to detect these forgeries as these patterns need continuous updating. Machine Learning algorithms are the best tool which evolves with more dataset and shows consistent higher detection rates with time. 

Identity Theft: Attackers or cybercriminals can hack into their victims accounts and gain access to their credentials like, name, bank account details, email address, passwords, etc. They can use these credentials to cause harm to their victim. There are three types of identity theft: real name theft, account takeover, and synthetic theft.
